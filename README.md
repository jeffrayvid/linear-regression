# linear-regression
Created a linear regression algorithm from scratch and evaluated performance using cross-validation

This was my first 'real' data mining project in school. 
The purpose of this was to develop and assess a linear regression model from scratch.
I did this using the following steps:
1) Using matrices, create a linear regression model on training data and assess performance on test data
 1a) Implement L2 regularization with lambda ranging from 0-150
 1b) Plot performance of each lambda to assess overfitting, MSE, and the optimal lambda value
2) Apply 10-fold cross-validation to assess performance of 1a and 1b, instead of training and test
3) Plot the learning curve of each model
